# AR Marker-Based Crowd Zombie Game


**Tools:** Unity AR

In the game you have a crowd of Zombies that wants to reach the safe zone without die. The game environment is represented by a field,
the zombies are on one side and the safe place is on the other side. In the field can be present different obstacles, some og them can be 
changed using marker-cards and others are fixed. The aim of the playes is to change the obstacles using cards and avoid the fixed ones to reach the safe zone.

**Stricted:** We need to find a way to use some sensor of the phone
- Weather data to apply them on the AR environment?
- Light sensor? If the room is dark, the phone turns on the flash
- Accelerometer? If we shock the phone something can happen

**Optional:**

- Maybe on the safe zone there are enemies (humans) and they try to reach zombies. So the cards also have to modify the obstacles to block the enemies.
